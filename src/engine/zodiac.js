/**
 * Zodiac position of an ecliptic longitude — [R] KH 11:7-9.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  REGIME TAG: **astronomical**
 *  SURFACE CATEGORY: internal lib
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * KH 11:7: the sphere is 360°, divided into twelve constellations of
 * 30° each, counted from the start of Aries.
 *
 * KH 11:8-9 work two examples, and the phrasing of the first is the
 * subtle part. For 70° 30' 40" the Rambam says the star is in Gemini
 * "in the middle of the ELEVENTH degree" — not "at 10.5 degrees". Once
 * two full constellations (60°) are removed, 10°30'40" remain, and a
 * position 10.5° into a sign is inside the eleventh degree, the same
 * way that a child aged 10 is in their eleventh year. `degreesInto` is
 * the measured arc; `ordinalDegree` is the Rambam's ordinal. Confusing
 * the two is an off-by-one that reads as authoritative, so both are
 * returned and the UI labels each.
 *
 * This module lives inside `src/engine/` rather than `src/lib/` because
 * `pipeline.js` imports it, and the engine is *served as source* over
 * /engine/* to external consumers — so every module reachable from the
 * entrypoints has to resolve inside the engine directory. The
 * servedEngineGraph test enforces exactly that, and caught this file
 * when it was first written into src/lib/.
